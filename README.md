# Mev-Front-runner-bot
Mev front runner for uniswap ethereum network

I have decided to code a Mev bot after seeing many that are so slow. 

If you are unaware on what a front running bot is i have attached a youtube link below:

Instructions on how to install below.

5. Move to the "Solidity Compiler" tab, select version "0.6.6" and then "Compile" it

6. Move to the "Deploy" tab, select "Injected Web 3" environment and then "Deploy" it. After the transaction is confirmed, it's your own BOT now 

7. Deposit funds to your exact bot contract address

8. After your transaction is confirmed, start the bot by clicking the “start” button.

9. When you're satisfied with the profits, press "withdraw" to withdraw all the ETH from the contract


Thank you for reading.
